## Examination Result Management System

Educational institutions need to efficiently manage student enrollments, academic programs, batches, subjects, teacher assignments, and most importantly student results. Manual management of such data is error-prone, time-consuming, and lacks transparency. The Student Examination Result Management System (SRMS) is designed to automate and streamline these processes, ensuring accuracy, security, and ease of access for all stakeholders.
With the Student Examination Result Management System:
• Administrators can add new students, batches, academic years, subjects, and assign teachers to subjects.
• Faculty/Teachers can enter and update marks for students, with the system automatically calculating grades based on institutional rules.
